    <p>Just had a wonderful dinner with a friend of mine. This guy isn’t just a friend, he is a mentor to me in some ways. The following is what I learnt from him tonight.</p>

<p>A degree from a university is useful only if you really know how to apply the knowledge you learnt, while pursuing your degree, to the work place in the future. It is useless if you are just trying to get a degree for the purpose of getting one.</p>

<p>Soft skills are just a way to gain more opportunities; however, hard skills are the skills that secure those opportunities.</p>

<p>If you think you can leave your dreams for tomorrow and keep doing things that you don’t like, then you might be wasting time. Because when you are “ready” to pursue your dreams, you are either too old, not willing to give up everything that you’ve worked over the dozens of years, or you don’t have the skills/ability to pursue that path anymore. So go pursue your dreams while you’re young, nothing is impossible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“How do you get up every morning after only sleeping for 3 hours?” “When I hear my alarm run off, when I do hear it, I <em>just</em> get up, brush my teeth and wash my face.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My friend will continue his own journey abroad after this semester. I hope him all the best. I will work hard as well. Hopefully someday in the future we can meet again!</p>
