    <ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Outliers</strong> - The curiosity of seeing one of my classmates do exceptionally well both in school and in life led me to reading this book; this book ties lots of real-world examples closely together and observing the information that people normally neglect.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Tipping Point</strong> - A awesome marketing, sociology, psychology, consumer behavior book that touches on different aspects of  ”short-cut” finding in this complex business world.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Blink</strong> - Mostly psychology related as well as consumer behavior; however, I didn’t take too much away from that book.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Thinking Fast and Slow</strong> - A very in depth psychology nonfiction book that is written by an Economics Noble Prize Winner, who elaborates thoroughly on the psychological side of the human brain and provide a myriad of examples that help explain difficult professional psychological concepts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Getting to Yes</strong> - A negotiation handbook that teaches the reader different types of negotiation techniques needed to overcome almost all possible scenarios; however, please treat this book as a handbook not as a “one-time” read.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>80/20 Principle</strong> - Personally, my very first nonfiction book that later dug up my time management potential and vastly increased my efficiency and effectiveness in task accomplishments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us</strong> - Took a lot of different approaches towards motivating people in business and life, but also connected lots of concepts that I learnt in my I/O psychology class to real world examples, which is really easy to comprehend; needless to say the life-applicable tips at the back of the book.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Liars Poker</strong> - A really good and funny wall-street depiction written by a former wall-street trader in the last few decades; however, this book requires adequate knowledge of finance/economics to understand it’s black humor.</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Getting Things Done</strong> - This book is also a good handbook in complement with the GTD software/apps, most of the examples are concrete summaries from real life experiences.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>7 Habits of Highly Effective People</strong> - I personally haven’t completely finished the book because some of the tips the book gives are hard to relate to my life.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Snowball: Warren Buffet and the Business of Life</strong> - A huge biography that is recommended by lots of my upper-year friends who are interested in the finance career as well as a deeper understanding of this Oracle of Omaha.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The 4-hour Work Week</strong> - This book is broken down into 4 parts (DEAL), D for Definition, E for Elimination, A for Automation, L for Liberation, in which the Automation part intrigues me the most mostly because I hate spending large chunks of time doing repetitive tasks, instead, outsourcing them to professional personnel is the choice for the New Rich (NR, this concept is talked thoroughly through the book)</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Hacking Work</strong> - Since I was a kid, I hate to play by the rules for all kind of games, from the single player hacks to MMO games hacks, this made me feel I saved up a lot of useless time; by transferring this mindset to the workplace as well as life, companies tend to assign tasks to employees with the effort of reaching cost-savings for the company as a whole, now here is where this book comes into place - there are many ways to do those tasks, why not go around the rules once for a while (of course, you don’t wanna break the law as an expense).</li>
</ul>

<p>Hope this gave you, at least, some inspiration on what books to pursue in the near future. :)</p>
