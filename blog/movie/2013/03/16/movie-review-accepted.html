    <p>Just finished watching this movie during my dinner break. It was awesome, to say the least!</p>

<p>I was kind of unsure about my career and education these past years, because I found it really important to choose a “right” path for myself in my early 20s. Going to university/college is a dream for most people, and this has been a stereotype for most asian parents. But, I think the institute or the college itself doesn’t really have big impact on what we learn, rather it is the content and the experience during these four years that makes a difference in our lives. If that experience is rewarding, whether it’s making important friends or learning something useful for ourselves, then I believe it’s a good “institute” despite any fame or prestige.</p>

<p>This movie depicted how some college-rejected kids started their own college from scratch, and how they implemented their own unique teaching style where students can also be teachers - learning from each other. And most importantly, they studied what they love!</p>

<p>Nowadays, there is too much distraction in life that deters ourselves from our true interest. Sometimes, we might be tempted to study a major because it’s known to be a “good-paying” occupation. I believe, if your education is aligned with your passion, you’ll have a much greater chance of leading a happier life and it’s just a matter of time before you succeed. No matter what other people think of you, everyone is different in many ways, so why not embrace your uniqueness and do something worthwhile with your life.</p>

<p>P.S. I personally really liked the last scene where the kids were in the court facing the law suits and the speech that B made, that was superb.</p>
