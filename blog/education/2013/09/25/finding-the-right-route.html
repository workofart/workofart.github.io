    <p>It has been approximately 24 days since classes have started and I have gotten used to the work and life style in business school, the case method and socializing all the way.</p>

<p>Most of the courses here are taught in the form of case studies, where the learning, supposedly comes from students’ contribution (either comment, question, or answer). However, I think this might not be an suitable teaching/learning method for myself. Many of classmates (including myself) haven’t been in the professional world long enough to develop a deep understanding of a specific domain or be in a position to provide a professional perspective towards our case topics. In addition, despite coming from different majors in our first two years of undergraduate studies, most of the courses were very basic foundational courses, which doesn’t provide much domain knowledge to complement our case studies. To me, this is just like a group of people talking about commonsense and personal experience in almost every class. I personally envisioned university classes to build foundations before going into a discussion. Maybe some people like this but I feel like I haven’t really gotten much out of my classes in my first month.</p>

<p>The thought of wasting time here made me think another direction - transfer. I have done a bit of research in the past few days regarding transferring to another program in another university. There are many options out there, but I understand that transferring from a university in third year is definitely a risky thought just based on the transfer credit policies, not to mention the complicated processes I would have to go through in order for me to successfully transfer with the minimum amount of delay in graduation.</p>

<p>I’m still debating on this thought, and I will definitely give myself a clear direction of where I want and will go in the near future. Remember, not making a change is still a decision. I don’t want to leave another regret like the one I left when I applied for university. </p>

<p>We’ll see……to be continued</p>
