    <p>The thing that has been puzzling me for the few days was my career problem. I had come across some computer programming while working on my start-up venture. I really enjoyed working on technical problems, which made me rethink why I am here now, studying business. </p>

<p>I eventually decided to choose business a my major in university after my father’s pursuation. He used to work in a tech company as a programmer for decade or so. He mentioned that being a computer programmer is very dependent on age and mental capabilities. On the other hand, by pursuing a business degree, your worth will be directly proportional to your experience. The older you get, the more experience you accumulate, and the more valuable you are. At that time, it made sense to me.</p>

<p>I had a passion for computers when I was 3, during which I played my first computer game CyberDogs. After then, I became infatuated with computers and the like. Anything related to computers could easily intrigue the tech-side of me. During elementary school, middle school and high school, I didn’t spend much time in computer class in school because it was honestly quite shallow for me. I taught myself via a self-led exploration into the computer world. The secret formula would be - whenever I face a new computer-related problem, I would go online and search for help. My memory seems to be very good with things that I’m interested in, and I rarely have to search for the same problem a second time. Many people told me that I had a talent for computers, and I can feel it too. I just don’t know whether this path, that I’m walking along now, will lead to the life I want in the future or not. I’m puzzled, I really do need a mentor who can understand my situation and can lend a hand to me at the moment.</p>

<p>I guess will just follow the safest route and finish my business administration bachelor’s degree, and go on from there.</p>

<p>Edit: I didn’t finish eventually :P</p>
